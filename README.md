# OrbScript
OrbScript - "the best programming language". It's low level, simple, has it's own compiler.
Unique and simple syntax!!!
## Syntax
Every line must end with percent sign (%).
Every line must have a line number inside square brackets, except encoding, title variables and comments.

Example:
```
$$__encoding: "utf-8"$%           ? encoding
$$title__: "exampleProgram"$%     ? title

[0] package "exampleProgram"%     ? line 0
```

Comments:
```
? single line comment

<* multi line comment
example line 1
example line 2
example line 3 *>
```
